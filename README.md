# Build Rust Artifact Action

A GitHub action to build Rust binaries and attach them to GitHub release.

**This action is made to be chained after the [Rust Release Action](https://github.com/seaofvoices/rust-release-action).**

The Rust Release Action outputs a build matrix that is consumed by this action to build Rust binaries across Windows, MacOs (`x86_64` and `aarch64`) and Linux (`x86_64` and `aarch64`).
